Bjerk supports the culture and music festival Oslo Jazz and has contributed
development of their websites. Here's what Head of Marketing and
Communication says about the collaboration.
<h2 withQuotes={true}>
    Bjerk has been a very good resource and sparring partner for development
     of new website for Oslo Jazz Festival. They have been able to see our needs and
     find good ways to fulfill this. The experience of working with Bjerk is
     an experience of being included as an active party in
     the development process, instead of just being a buyer of a product.
