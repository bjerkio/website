'We at Bjerk believe that open source code is one of the most important things in programming because it is a two-way transaction where we are both a consumer and a contributor. Such an approach also ensures that we deliver a product of the highest quality. Bjerk strongly believes that it is not only important to work together to achieve the goals, but also to solve problems in technology. ',    
'Open source code also gives our customers great freedom of choice and movement if they choose to collaborate with someone else along the way.',
