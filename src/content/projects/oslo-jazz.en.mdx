Bjerk supports the culture and music festival Oslo Jazz and has contributed
development of their websites. Here's what Head of Marketing and Communication
says about the collaboration.

> **@André Ishak** – Bjerk has been a very good resource and development partner
> for the Oslo Jazz Festival website. They have been able to see our needs and
> find good ways to fulfill this. Working with Bjerk is an experience of being
> included as an active part in the development process, instead of just being a
> buyer of a product.
